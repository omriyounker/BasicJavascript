          <h2>Javascript Basics</h2>
          <p>Javascript is a cross platform, object oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. Javascript lives inside a host environment(a web browser or Node serve), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="0">Variable Declaration</a> Javascript variables are containers for storing data values - Imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="purple">var x</span>
            </li>
	          <li>
              <a href="0">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cupcan now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. the = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="purple">var x = 10</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="0">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six daata types that are Javascript primitives: Boolean - <span class="purple">true</span> or <span class="purple">false;</span> null - <span class="purple">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="purple">42</span> or <span class="purple">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks";</span> Array<span class="purple">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="purple">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="0">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="purple">if</span> a specific condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="purple">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="purple">else</span> we execute this  block of code;
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="0">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="0">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a codeblock. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an exampleimaging we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next weplace the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
